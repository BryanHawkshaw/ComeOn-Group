* A/B Testing For Conversion Rate Optimization
  The objective of this project was to determine if the new design would lead to an increase in conversion rates.
  The null hypothesis was the new design does not increase conversion rates.
  The alternative hypothesis was the new design increases conversion rates.

* Customer Segmentation Analysis
  The objective of this project was to identify customer segments based on their demographics and behaviour. Used KMeans clustering with an optimal number of clusters determined by the elbow method and silhouette score.
  Recommendations:
1) Target Segment A with premium offers
2) Improve engagement for Segment B through loyalty programs.
